## About
SnakeEater causes [the acapella version of the title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aYeoR9LVlI) from Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater to begin playing whenever you mount a ladder. Will by default only trigger on ladders above a certain length, which may be re-configured along with various audio parameters.

[LethalConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AinaVT/LethalConfig/) is optional, but recommended for in-game configuration.
